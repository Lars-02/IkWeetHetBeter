            <h1>Privacy voorwaarden</h1>
            <h6>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you use Ikweethet-Beter.nl (our Site), you will be
                regarded
                as having
                read and accepted this Privacy Policy. If you don’t wish to be bound by what you read below, you
                shouldn’t
                use our Site.</h6>
            <h3>Our Privacy Policy explains</h3>
            <p>What information we collect and how we collect it
                How we use that information
                How to find out more about our policies
                This is a very important policy page and we hope you will read it carefully.</p>
            <h3>Information we collect</h3>
            <p>We do not ask you or anyone else to give us any personal information in order to use Ikweethet-Beter.</p>
            <p>We do collect anonymised information to provide a better service to all our users.</p>
            <p>The only instance when we do collect personal information – specifically, your name and email address -
                is
                if, and only if, you submit a messages to us via our site.</p>

            <h3>We collect information in the following ways:</h3>
            <h4>Personal data collection</h4>
            <p>We ask for your email address to avoid bogus reviews being submitted. We will never share your data with
                any
                third-party.</p>
            <h3>What we do with all the data</h3>
            <h4>Data use and transfer</h4>
            <p>We will only use your information to contact you about your profile.</p>
            <h4>Data retention</h4>
            <p>Your Name and email address, exactly as submitted to us, will be stored in our secure reviews database
                for
                as long as your review is published on our Site.</p>
            <h4>Data deletion</h4>
            <p>If you wish to have your name, other personal details and email address removed from our database, please
                email your request to help@ikweethet-beter.nl.</p>
            Data retention
            <p>Please note, the request must originate from the email address submitted as part of the review, as proof
                of
                authenticity.</p>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>We occasionally ask our visitors to apply to take part in testing new features of our website. As part of
                the application, visitors will be asked to provide their email address via a submission form.</p>
            <p>Not all applications are successful and the email addresses submitted by all unsuccessful applicants will
                be
                purged once the recruitment phase is complete.

                If you have been selected to participate in one of our tests, we will only email you instructions on how
                to
                carry out the test(s), and the agreed reward once the test(s) has been adequately completed.

                Your email address will be stored securely until the testing period is over, at which point they will be
                purged.

                We may also ask if you would like to be contacted to participate in future tests. If you give us consent
                to
                do so, your email address will be added to our User Testing email list.

                If at any point you wish to have your email address removed from this list, and permanently purged from
                our
                records, please email your request to help@ikweethet-beter.nl.</p>
            <h3>Site Analytics</h3>
            <p>Every time anyone visits our Site, we collect anonymised information about that visit. Like most big
                websites, we do this through Google Analytics software to better understand how people use our site.
                While
                we do not use Google Analytics to collect any personally identifying information (such as name or
                address),
                we do collect the following kinds of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The pages you visit.</li>
                <li>How long you spend on each page of our Site.</li>
                <li>How you got to our Site</li>
                <li>What kind of device you were using</li>
                <li>Your home country and browser settings such as language</li>
                <li>We also sometimes use other third-party analytics tools, such as Hotjar, that collect information
                    about
                    how
                    you interact with our Site, such as what you click on and the parts of the page you spend most time
                    on.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use this information to better understand our customers and their needs in order to improve our
                service.</p>

            <p>We use this information to better understand our customers and their needs in order to improve our

            <h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
            <p>Like most websites, Ikweethet-Beter puts small files (known as cookies) onto your computer to collect
                information
                about how you browse our Site.

                Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you
                find
                useful and which you do not, and by allowing us to earn commissions.

                A cookie does not give us access to your computer or any information about you. You can choose to accept

                to
                do this.

                We may implement third party advertising or other content on the Site that may use clear gifs or other
                forms
                of web beacons, which allow the third party content provider to read and write Cookies to your web
                browser
                in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Site.</p>

            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>We may, from time to time, update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes to our privacy practices in
                accordance with changes to legislation, best practice or enhancements to Ikweethet-Beter. We will let
                you know what
                these changes are by posting them to this page, but it is your responsibility as a user to make sure
                that
                you are aware of them, by checking for any changes on a regular basis. Changes will become effective as
                soon
                as they are posted.</p>
